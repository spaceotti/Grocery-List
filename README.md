# React + TypeScript Practice Project

This repository contains a small **React + TypeScript** practice project created to refresh React fundamentals and learn modern TypeScript patterns in a React environment.

The focus of this project is **clean component structure, typed state, and predictable data flow**, rather than styling or advanced libraries.

---

## Goals

- Refresh React fundamentals (hooks, props, state)
- Learn and apply TypeScript in a React project
- Practice state lifting and component communication
- Build a small, clean project suitable for a Junior-level portfolio

---

## Concepts Covered

- Functional components
- `useState` with TypeScript generics
- State lifting (parent-controlled state)
- Typed props and callbacks
- Immutable state updates (`map`, `filter`)
- Component decomposition
- Conditional rendering & styling
- Basic CRUD logic (check / delete items)

---

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- react-icons
- CSS (global styles)

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Notes

- This project is intentionally simple and focused on fundamentals
- Styling is minimal and kept in a single CSS file
- The project is meant as a learning and portfolio reference

---

## Next Steps

- Add item creation (input + form)
- Persist data using `localStorage`
- Refactor state logic into a custom hook
- Improve accessibility
